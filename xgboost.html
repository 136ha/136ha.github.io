        <h1>ABOUT XGBOOST</h1>
        <p><a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank"><strong>xgboost</strong></a> is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable.
        <br>It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework.
        <br>XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.
        <br>The same code runs on major distributed environment (Hadoop, SGE, MPI) and can solve problems beyond billions of examples.
